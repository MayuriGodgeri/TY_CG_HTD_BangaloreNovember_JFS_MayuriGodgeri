               <td><p>There exists a beautifully secret spot near the coast guard colony in Chicolna, in south Goa hidden away from the itineraries of most tourists in Goa. Most of the people don’t know about this place, to reach this place you have to walk into a jungle which than leads to this treasure place. There is beautiful heart shape lake located inside this. This place is good for photography also. So you have to walk through the bushes, you cannot take your vehicle inside. Its kind of a tracking place. You will seriously enjoy the view of this place and it has a beautiful beach also, where you can play. And especially in the evening there is a beautiful sunset view and cool breeze which you will enjoy. Must visit this place in GOA.  </pThere></td>
